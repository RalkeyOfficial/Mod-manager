/// The total unpacked size named by `7z l -slt`, or null if the output says
/// nothing usable.
///
/// `-slt` prints one block per entry, which is what makes this parseable at all
/// — the default table is column-aligned prose with a localized summary line:
///
/// ```
/// Path = mod/body.dds
/// Folder = -
/// Size = 5592448
/// Packed Size = 4194304
/// ```
///
/// **`Size` and nothing else.** `Packed Size` is what the archive holds, which
/// is the number that is already on disk rather than the one about to be
/// written; the header block's `Physical Size` is the archive file itself. Both
/// are excluded by anchoring the match at the start of the line.
///
/// Directory entries carry `Size = 0` or none at all, so they contribute
/// nothing — correct, since a directory costs no meaningful space.
///
/// Returns null rather than 0 for output with no entries: an archive whose
/// listing could not be read is unknown, and unknown means "do not check". A
/// genuinely empty archive is also unknown by this rule, which costs nothing —
/// there is no space question about unpacking nothing.
