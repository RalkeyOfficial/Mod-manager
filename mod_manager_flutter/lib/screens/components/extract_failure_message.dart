/// Shared because the two places an archive is extracted — a marketplace
/// install and an update being applied — had this composed inline, byte for
/// byte, which is how the two wordings drift apart on the next edit.
///
/// **The extractor's own reason string is deliberately dropped.** It is raw
/// 7-Zip stderr or a literal from `ArchiveService`, untranslated whichever
/// locale is running, and it describes the app's own tooling. It stays on the
/// result and in the console for diagnostics.
///
/// What is *not* dropped is [ExtractFailure], because one of its two values is
/// something the user can act on. A missing 7-Zip is not a broken archive: the
/// download is fine and the fix is to install a tool, which the generic wording
/// ("the file is still at …, extract it by hand") actively steers away from by
/// implying the app has done all it can.
